# punktkonfig-sys

Extended system configs — just the few files from `/etc`, `/boot`, and `/usr/local` that I’ve actually edited.

These are real configs I use on real hardware (usually antiX). Mostly small boot tweaks and performance changes. Nothing fancy — just what I need.

## ⚠️ Heads up  
These are the system configs I mess with. If you apply them blindly, I have no idea what’s gonna happen.  
Sorry if things go bad. :) Use at your own risk.

## Looking for normal dotfiles?

If you're looking for my regular dotfiles (terminals, editors, shells, window managers), check out [punktkonfig](https://github.com/Anonpink/punktkonfig).
